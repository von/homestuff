See |UltiSnips-snippet-search-path| for an explanation of where directories
with snippet definitions are expected.

UltiSnips follows the same search pattern that Vim itself uses when searching
for ftplugins: While iterating over the snippet definition directories found,
files are listed with the following glob patterns: ft.snippets, ft_*.snippets,
ft/*. ft is the current 'filetype', and the "*" matches anything, for example:
   ruby.snippets
   c.snippets
   c_mine.snippets
   c/a
   c/b.snippets
   perl.snippets
Those files are than traversed in order to gather snippet definitions for the
various file types. A special filetype is all, e.g.  >
   all.snippets
   all/a.snippets
which contains snippets that are always expanded, no matter what file type is
defined.
