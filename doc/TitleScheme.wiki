= My Window and Tab Title Scheme =

[[/index|Back to Index]]

==  Overview  ==

I use zsh in tmux in iTerm, and the following titles/names are in play:
  * iTerm has a tab and window title
  * tmux has a window name and pane title.

If I'm not running in tmux, zsh sets the iTerm tab and window title.

If I'm running in tmux, the window name is static and defined by my tm session
scripts. The pane title is set by zsh or vim and propagated to the iTerm
window and tab title by tmux.

== Zsh ==

If not in tmux, zsh sets the window and tab name via oh-my-zsh

If in tmux, zsh sets the pane title when displaying the prompt and before
running a command. Configuration is in zsh/zsh.d/title.zsh

== vim ==

vim will set the tmux pane title if it is running in tmux in
vim/conf/title.vim

== tmux/tm ==

tmux sets the iTerm tab and window titles based on set-titles-string in
tmux/tmux.conf, which uses the session and window names.
tmux also displays the session and window name at the bottom of it's window.
Window names are set by tm startup scripts in tmux/sessions/

== iTerm ==

iTerm adds iTerm profile name (unless it is Default) to the window name.
